                Singapore is easy to explore, safe, and very tourist-friendly.  Most people speak 
                English and the public transport is excellent!

                <p><span class="info-label">Best Way to Travel: MRT (Mass Rapid Transit)</span></p>
                <p>
                    The MRT is Singapore's train system.  It's fast, cheap, and air-conditioned! 
                    You can go almost anywhere in Singapore using the MRT.  Trains run from 5:30 AM 
                    to midnight. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Buy an EZ-Link card or Singapore Tourist Pass at any MRT station.  The Tourist Pass 
                    gives you unlimited rides for 1, 2, or 3 days!  Regular fares cost $1-2 per trip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Buses are also good but more confusing.  Taxis and Grab (like Uber) are available 
                    but more expensive. Walking is nice too - Singapore is very safe!

                <p><span class="info-label">Weather: Hot and humid all year! </span></p>
                <p>
                    Singapore has tropical weather.  It's always hot (25-32°C / 77-90°F) and humid. 
                    There is no winter or summer - just wet season and dry season. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Dry Season (February to April):</strong> Less rain, good for outdoor activities.   
                    This is peak tourist season so it's more crowded. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Wet Season (November to January):</strong> More rain but usually just short 
                    showers.  Cheaper hotels and fewer tourists!  Bring an umbrella. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pro tip: Always bring sunscreen, water, and an umbrella no matter when you visit!

                    Singapore can be expensive, but there are many FREE things to do! Here's how to save money:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Free Attractions:</strong> Gardens by the Bay (outdoor), Merlion Park, Chinatown, 
                    Little India, walking along Marina Bay, and all beaches are FREE!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Cheap Food:</strong> Eat at hawker centres (food courts). Meals cost $3-5 instead 
                    of $15-30 at restaurants. Try Maxwell Food Centre, Lau Pa Sat, or Chinatown Complex.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Tourist Passes:</strong> Buy combination tickets for multiple attractions to save money.  
                    Use the Tourist Pass for unlimited MRT rides.
