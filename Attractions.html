                        is the Supertree Grove - giant tree structures that light up at night with music!   
                        The light show is FREE and happens at 7: 45 PM and 8:45 PM every night.

                        There are also two big domes:  the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest.  The Cloud Forest has 
                        a giant indoor waterfall!  Remember to bring a jacket because the domes are very cold inside.
